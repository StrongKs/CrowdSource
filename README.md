## Project name
Crowd Source AI

## Project description
Crowd Source is a tool for communities to communicate with first responders in the event of a crisis. Often during events like flash floods, earthquakes, and fires, 911 operators become overwhelmed and vital/live information does not reach first responders. With Crowd Source, people will be able to send messages tagged to their location with a description of issues in their area such as road flooding, building fires, and car accidents. Then a LLM will aggregate the messages from the people in an area to give first responders a concise summary of the state of the community to help them navigate safely and quickly address the community's needs in an city-wide emergency. Users will also be able to submit photos with their messages which the LLM may hyperlink in the summary for first responders to view.
